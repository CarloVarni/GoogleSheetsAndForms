{"Developing GPU demonstrator of ACTS": {"title": "Developing GPU demonstrator of ACTS", "description": "The project aims for developing an R&D line of ACTS for GPU demonstrator, a.k.a. traccc. The experiences and lessons from traccc will be put into ACTS: It is expected to investigate the optimal event data model (EDM) and algorithms for a full GPU track reconstruction. The demonstrator is based on c++ language, and the targeted GPU APIs are cuda, sycl and hip. Students will gain experience in writing track reconstruction codes, which include seed finding and track fitting, for either cpu or gpu based on their interests and research backgrounds.", "other": [], "contact": ["Beomki Yeo"], "email": ["beomki.yeo@berkeley.edu"]}}
